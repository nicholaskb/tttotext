# Updates

## 2025-06-04

This repository contains only placeholder implementations for the TikTok transcript pipeline. To ensure readiness for the real code, an extensive set of pytest cases was added in `tests/test_pipeline_additional.py`.

### Reasoning
1. **Comprehensive coverage** – The new tests check normal behaviour, failure scenarios, and boundary conditions for all pipeline steps (`download_video`, `extract_audio`, `transcribe_audio`, and `clean_text`).
2. **Integration check** – A final test simulates the entire flow using monkeypatching so that the interface between stages is validated before any real network or audio logic is written.
3. **Graceful skipping** – Because the actual pipeline is not implemented, each test is marked with `@pytest.mark.skipif` to avoid spurious failures. This allows the test suite to run cleanly while still documenting expected behaviour.

These decisions were taken to create a clear specification of pipeline behaviour. Once real code is available, removing the skip markers will immediately verify whether the implementation meets these expectations.

## 2025-06-05

Added a small command line interface to `pipeline.py` so the pipeline can be run directly using `python -m pipeline <url>`. This aids manual testing and demonstrates how to produce a transcript from a TikTok URL (falling back to placeholder text when dependencies are missing or network access is unavailable).

## 2025-06-06

Introduced a `requirements.txt` file listing optional dependencies
(`yt_dlp`, `moviepy`, and `speech_recognition`). Updated the README with
instructions on installing these packages so that the pipeline can fetch
real transcripts when network access and the required libraries are
available.


## 2025-06-07

Added CLI integration test to ensure the module prints the transcript when executed directly. Documented how to run tests in the README.

## 2025-06-08

Implemented `save_transcript` to write cleaned text to a file. This addition enables
easier sharing of transcripts and is covered by a new pytest case ensuring the file
is created correctly.
## 2025-06-09

Implemented minimal versions of the pipeline functions so the test suite fully executes.
All 21 tests now pass, demonstrating the offline-ready download, extraction, transcription,
and cleaning logic.

## 2025-06-10

Enhanced the command line interface with an optional `--output` argument to
save the transcript directly to a file. Documentation was updated accordingly
and a new test ensures the CLI writes the transcript when this flag is used.

## 2025-06-11

Added `copy_transcript` to copy a fetched transcript to the clipboard. The CLI
now accepts a `--copy` flag for this functionality. Updated documentation and
tests accordingly.

## 2025-06-12

Introduced `share_transcript` to upload a transcript to an online paste service.
The CLI gained a `--share` flag to expose this capability. Documentation and new
tests demonstrate the behaviour and verify that failures gracefully return the
local transcript text.

## 2025-06-13

Documented the pipeline architecture and comprehensive test coverage in the
README. These clarifications highlight the offline fallbacks and reassure new
contributors that running `pytest` requires no network access.

## 2025-06-14

Expanded the README test instructions to mention the additional test module and
clarified that twenty-five tests currently pass. This makes it easier for new
contributors to understand the scope of the suite and confirm success after
changes.


## 2025-06-15

Consolidated pipeline and tests so that all functions are implemented and every test executes. The commit labeled "Applying previous commit" bundles prior changes into a single update. All 25 tests now pass on a clean checkout, demonstrating a functional offline pipeline.

## 2025-06-16

Revalidated the pipeline and test suite. All 25 tests pass on a clean checkout using the implemented offline fallbacks. No further code changes were required.

## 2025-06-17

Expanded the README with a step-by-step example showing how to extract a
transcript in Python by calling the underlying helper functions individually.
This clarifies how each stage fits together for users who wish to customise the
pipeline or examine intermediate files.
